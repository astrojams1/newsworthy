/**
 * An OpenAPI description of the caller-facing API, served from
 * /api/openapi.json.
 *
 * Why this exists: ChatGPT cannot submit a reading through browsing. Its
 * interpreter has no network, and its browser refuses to fetch a URL the model
 * assembled — a model-built URL carrying a token is the exfiltration shape that
 * guard exists to block, so no wording defeats it. Both limits were observed in
 * a real caller's trace.
 *
 * The supported path there is a Custom GPT Action, which takes a schema like
 * this one plus an API key, and issues real POSTs with a real header. So the
 * same two calls a Claude-side caller makes with curl are described here for an
 * agent that can only reach the network through a declared tool.
 *
 * Served unauthenticated on purpose: it describes a token-gated API without
 * containing a token, and the schema importer that fetches it has no way to
 * present one. The prompt itself stays behind /api/instructions.
