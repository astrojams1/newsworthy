# Newsworthy

The news anti-app: a number out of 10 and one sentence, no headlines. Claude
rates the current top news on a harsh scale; the front page shows only the
score and the reason.

## Workflow

- **Branch off `main`, open a PR into `main`, merge there.** Do not push
  directly to `main`. `main` is both the GitHub default branch and Vercel's
  production branch.
- A push to `main` deploys to production. Every other branch deploys as a
  Vercel preview.
- Run `npm test` before pushing. No cloud database is needed — see Testing.

## Layout

| Path | |
|---|---|
| `src/server.js` | The whole HTTP surface. Also the Vercel entrypoint. |
| `src/rate.js` | Calls Claude, parses the verdict, writes the row. |
| `src/prompts.js` | Append-only prompt registry. |
| `src/pricing.js` | Model rate card and cost estimation. |
| `src/config.js` | Effective model/cadence: database settings over env. |
| `src/db.js`, `src/sql.js` | Postgres access and schema. |
| `public/` | Two static pages, no build step. |

## Things that are not obvious

**The entrypoint must have no exports.** Vercel's Node runtime validates
`src/server.js`'s exports and captures its `listen()` call. A named-only export
is rejected (`The default export must be a function or server`); exporting the
`Server` instance as default fails at boot. Both were tried. Leave it as a
side-effect-only module.

**Readings can come from elsewhere.** An external agent can rate the news with
its own model and `POST /api/readings`; the row is stored with `source =
'external'` plus the caller's name, self-reported model and usage. Its prompt
hash and text always come from our registry, never from the request, so a
reading stays traceable. `/api/instructions` serves the whole caller workflow with the
prompt embedded, so a caller agent is configured with a URL rather than pasted
text — `src/caller.js` is the single copy. `CALLER_TOKEN` gates it.
Serve it as `text/plain`: an agent's fetch tool rejected `text/markdown` before
exposing the body.

**The cron only fires if nothing arrived within the interval.** A rolling
window from the newest reading, not the slot boundary — an external reading at
03:59 must suppress an 04:00 run, which slot alignment alone would not do. That
is what keeps this cheap: a reading submitted elsewhere is a reading this app
does not pay for.

**Cadence is enforced by the slot, not the cron schedule.** `vercel.json` ticks
every 15 minutes. Each reading claims a `slot` floored to the configured
interval, guarded by a partial unique index (`ratings (slot) WHERE status =
'ok'`). Ticks inside an interval find the slot filled and return without calling
the model. So cadence is changeable from `/admin` with no redeploy — but it
cannot go finer than the cron tick, and intervals must be multiples of it.
Failures, manual runs and external readings carry `slot = NULL` so they neither
block nor collide; external readings suppress the cron by being recent, not by
claiming a slot.

**Environment variables are baked in at build time.** Adding a variable, or
connecting a storage integration, changes nothing until you redeploy. `/healthz`
reports what the *running* function can see — database reachability, key and
secret presence, the Postgres variable names found, and the serving branch and
commit. Check it before debugging anything else.

**Vercel's production branch lives under Settings → Environments → Production →
Branch Tracking**, not Settings → Git.

**Avoid native dependencies.** `better-sqlite3` broke the first deploy: npm
skipped its install script, so the binding was missing and the import threw at
cold start. Prefer pure-JS or HTTP-based drivers.

**Prompts are append-only.** Never edit a published version in `src/prompts.js`
— add the next one. Rows store the version, a SHA-256 of the exact text sent,
and that text, so a reading stays traceable.

## Cost

Roughly **$0.26 per run** on Opus 5: ~40k input tokens (search results land in
the context window) plus web search at $10/1,000 searches. That is ~$767/month
at 15-minute cadence, so **the default is every 4 hours (~$48/month)**. Model
and cadence are both adjustable at `/admin`. Every row stores the cost computed
at write time, so history keeps the price that applied.

Models are an allowlist in `src/pricing.js` — adding one requires its rates.

## Testing

```bash
npm test        # 22 tests; database tests run against PGlite, real Postgres
                # in-process, so the SQL is exercised rather than mocked
npm start       # needs DATABASE_URL; NEWSWORTHY_MOCK=1 avoids API calls
```
